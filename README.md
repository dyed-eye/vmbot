:red_circle: **The project is out-dated!** :red_circle:

A simple Discord bot which main feature was setting up a private voice rooms on a server so anyone could create his/her own voice channel and customise it as far as it was possible.

The main goal of project was to get familiar with Discord's Node.js API and learn how to handle different events.
